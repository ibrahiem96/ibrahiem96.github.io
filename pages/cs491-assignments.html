<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Although both virtual reality and augmented reality have both existed for a couple of years now, and perhaps longer (without public knowledge), it is still quite amazing to experience both for the first time. In order to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each I need to discuss my experiences with each. So let us start at the beginning with in-classroom gadgets:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Common Phone/Tablet App</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The first thing to note about this is that anyone with a smartphone can utilize this tool. And that drastically increases your target audience. This means you can develop a tool that will be used by a lot of people, but it may not be as nice to experience because of a smartphone&rsquo;s limitations. However, an app can be further developed to work with changing technology. In terms of application, the apps we used were obviously for entertainment/news. In this field the apps would thrive, however they can also be used by industry--for example the Samsung Bixby vision app allows a user to take a picture of an object and then search or shop for it online.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">360 Video/Google Cardboard</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Again, like the last app this has its advantages in that it can be used by and targeted to a large audience. However, it has further limitations because not everyone with a smartphone will have google cardboard glasses or a vr-phone headset. It can be used in education (something that applies to the previous app as well) where students can go on virtual field trips and learn about places, things, they normally would never be able to see.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">VIVE Headmounted Display</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The VIVE headmounted display is most advantageous in that it provides a full virtual reality experience. Unlike the other platforms, which only allow you to experience VR visually, the VIVE allows to interact with virtual reality as well. Best demonstrated by the google earth application and the NVIDIA games, the VIVE allows us to experience virtual reality as it was intended. We can move objects, play with them, our movements are monitored as well. The main disadvantage is that, although commercialized, not everyone has access to such headsets. Moreover, these headsets have been proven to be dangerous to people and their environments. VR can confuse the brain to such an extent that if the user lets go of the fact that they are in VR then the body will reflect the brain&rsquo;s signals based on the virtual reality and not reality. The use cases the VIVE has are limitless, from education to gaming to industry, sports, you can think of anything. Why? Because VR is virtual reality. Anything that can be done in reality can be done in VR, and anything that can&rsquo;t be done in reality can be done in VR as well!</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">HoloLens</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The HoloLens show more of the augmented reality side of the applications. Like the app pokemon go that came out recently, the HoloLens allows us to interact with false objects in our reality rather than creating objects in a false reality. This means that the technology has to detect and interpret reality. The best place this can be applied to I think is medicine. If a doctor had an overlay of the patient&rsquo;s inside while performing surgery, it would make things much easier and they wouldn&rsquo;t need to insert cameras and other foreign objects in the body. Advantages I would say are that it doesn&rsquo;t remove you completely from reality, but that is also a disadvantage as you are not fully immersed.</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">CAVE2</span></strong></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The CAVE2 prospers in the field of visual exploration. You can enlarge something like a molecule to the size of many many screens (I forget the exact number). Or you can explore something as big as the Giza pyramids. The options to visualize something to the tiniest of details is amazing here, but interaction is limited. You can view from different angles and such but it is difficult to really play with the object(s).</span></p>
