<h1>HOMEWORK 2</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google&rsquo;s AR translation app is quite efficient, however, when I sat down to think about it, I couldn&rsquo;t think of many practical uses for it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly, I live in a predominantly English-based society and also happen to be fluent in English, which why I don&rsquo;t have a real use for this app. But let&rsquo;s move beyond my societal bubble. If I was placed in a random city in Spain, I would find this app quite useful. Things from door signs to product ingredients, to directions--would all be in spanish, and could all be translated by this application. This would then be the application&rsquo;s primary and most important purpose.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving on, we can now discuss how best to fulfill our purpose. Taking out your phone, putting in the language you want to be deciphered, taking a picture of text on an object, having to highlight the text if not recognized--are all time consuming steps. Most likely the average person will come to a decision that it is more useful asking a person or even googling the word. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So then we can think about using a pair of AR glasses or contact lenses to create a better tool. The pros of this is that it saves times--a lot of time. Simply focus your eyes over some text you cannot read (the glasses will be set to translate every language except the one(s) you speak) and the glasses/lenses will give a translation. The cons, however, are similar to other augmented reality tools. How annoying would it be walking around downtown Madrid seeing every piece of text being translated (text popping up all around you blocking everything else in sight). Not only would it be annoying, it would also be very dangerous. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus we arrive at a conclusion that there must be some way to limit or control what gets translated. After thinking about it a little I thought perhaps the user could focus on an item for a while to translate it. But that would mean staring at an object in public for 5 seconds looking stupid. Another thought was to have a marker on your finger which the ar glasses can recognize. If you &lsquo;click&rsquo; or point at a piece of text the ar glasses will then focus on that.</span><br /><br /><br /></p>
